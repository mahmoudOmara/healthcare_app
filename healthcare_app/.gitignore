# This file, on the master branch, should never exist or be checked-in.
#
# On a *final* release branch, that is, what will ship to stable or beta, the
# file can be force added (git add --force) and checked-in in order to effectively
# "pin" the engine artifact version so the flutter tool does not need to use git
# to determine the engine artifacts.

# See https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/tool/Engine-artifacts.md.
